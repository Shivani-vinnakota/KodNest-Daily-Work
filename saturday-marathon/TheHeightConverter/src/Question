Question: 12

*Problem: The Height Converter*

You are part of a sports data management team. The team is developing a new feature for their application where the heights of players, currently recorded in inches, need to be displayed in feet for an international audience. Your task is to create a method that takes a height given in inches and converts it into feet.

*Hint:* The conversion factor from inches to feet is 1 foot = 12 inches.

Class Definition:

public class HeightConverter (

public double convertinchesToFeet(double inches);

Inputs

The method convertinchesToFeet(double inches) will receive one parameter:

-inches (0<= inches <= 10^9): a double representing the height in inches.

Outputs

The method will return a double-the height converted to feet.

**Example:

**Sample Input:

Height Converter converter = new HeightConverter();

converter.convertinchesToFeet(72.0);

Sample Output:
Note:

In the sample input, the height of the player is 72.0 inches. The height in feet is 72/12=6.00, so the method returns 6.00 as the output. Your method will be crucial in helping the sports data management team present the data in a format familiar to the international audience. Good luck, data manager!
